        Creates a new commit for a specific branch of a prompt. This endpoint allows users to record changes made to the branch, with a commit message detailing the updates. It supports workflows where changes need to be tracked and managed systematically.

        **Features**:
        - **Change Documentation**: Captures detailed descriptions of changes made in the commit message, providing context for future reference.
        - **Version Control**: Ensures systematic tracking of all changes, enabling easy rollback to previous states if needed.
        - **Collaborative Development**: Supports collaborative environments by recording contributions from multiple users.

        **Use Cases**:
        - Developers committing new changes or features to a branch.
        - Content managers updating prompt content and documenting the changes.
        - Teams collaborating on a project and needing a clear record of each member's contributions.

        Retrieves detailed information about a specific commit of a branch, or the most recent commit if 'latest' is specified as the commit ID. This endpoint is crucial for accessing historical data of branch commits for review or rollback purposes.

        **Features**:
        - **Historical Tracking**: Provides access to the specific details of a commit, including changes made, author, and timestamp.
        - **Latest Commit Access**: Supports retrieving the most recent commit using the 'latest' keyword, streamlining access to the current state of the branch.
        - **Detailed Insights**: Includes comprehensive commit information, aiding in understanding the evolution and decision-making process.

        **Use Cases**:
        - Retrieving past commits for audit or comparison purposes.
        - Accessing the latest commit to continue development or review current changes.
        - Integrating commit data into other systems for enhanced content lifecycle management.

    ApiKeyAuth:
      description: |
        API Key authentication provides a straightforward method for clients to authenticate requests. This scheme expects an API key to be supplied in the headers of each request. Clients must include the API key in the 'X-API-KEY' header field.

        **How to use**:
        - Obtain an API key from the API provider.
        - Include the API key in the header of each request to the API as follows:
          ```
          X-API-KEY: {api_key}
          ```
        - The API validates the key against its database, and if the key is valid, allows access to the requested resources.

        **Advantages**:
        - Simple and easy to implement.
        - Suitable for accessing public APIs where security requirements are not excessively strict.

        **Limitations**:
        - Less secure than more complex authentication methods, such as tokens, as API keys can be easily exposed in transit or storage.
        - API keys do not expire by default and revoking them requires direct intervention.

    BearerAuth:
      bearerFormat: JWT
      description: |
        Bearer Token authentication uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to verify the identity of the requester. This scheme is included in the Authorization header of each HTTP request using the Bearer format.

        **How to use**:
        - Obtain a JWT from the authentication server. Typically, this involves an initial request with credentials (username/password) to receive the token.
        - Include the token in the Authorization header of your HTTP requests as follows:
          ```
          Authorization: Bearer {token}
          ```
        - The server decodes the JWT to verify its validity and authorizes the request based on the token's payload and signature.

        **Advantages**:
        - Offers more security than API key authentication as the token content is protected by cryptographic algorithms.
        - Tokens can be designed to expire after a certain period, enhancing security by limiting the duration of their validity.

        **Limitations**:
        - Requires a more complex backend setup to issue and verify tokens.
        - Handling token renewal and revocation can add overhead to client and server implementations.

        **Example**:
        To access protected routes or resources, the client must authenticate by providing the JWT in the authorization header:
        ```
        Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiIxMjM0NTY3ODkwIiwibmFtZSI6IkpvaG4gRG9lIiw
